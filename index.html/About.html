            <p> the menu is a list of food and beverages offered to customers and the prices. A menu may be à la carte – which presents a list of options from which customers choose – or table d'hôte, in which case a pre-established sequence of courses is offered.
              Food is one of the basic necessities of life. Food contains nutrients—substances essential for the growth, repair, and maintenance of body tissues and for the regulation of vital processes.
              Tasty food and the anticipation of eating a great meal improves digestion in more ways than one. When you look forward to eating your meal and start taking in all its delicious aromas, you trigger the release of digestive enzymes in your body.
